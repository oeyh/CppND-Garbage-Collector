# Garbage Collector Project from Udacity C++
The project implements my own version of a smart pointer, or more specificly a shared pointer. This is like implementing a garbage collector. I completed the following implementations and verified that it does not have any memory leaks with the leak tester.

## Codes implemented
- Completed `Pointer` constructor, destructor and operator== overloading
- Completed `PtrDetails` class
